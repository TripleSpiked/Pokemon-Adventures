                  Professor Oak after helping capture all the Pokémon he 
                  accidentally set free. Bulbasaur, now named Saur, has since 
                  evolved into Ivysaur, and then to Venusaur. It has also been 
                  shown in the manga that Bulbasaur has the ability to suck in 
                  large amounts of air through his bulb, as seen in That Awful 
                  Arbok! where he sucked up the mist in Pokémon Tower as well as
                  the Gastly that made it.

                  Red had an Ivysaur named Saur that evolved from his Bulbasaur 
                  upon his arrival at Celadon City in Wartortle Wars. He evolved
                  into Venusaur during a battle with the legendary bird hybrid 
                  at Silph Co. in The Winged Legends.
                   Emerald rented an Ivysaur during his Battle Factory challenge

                   In Interrupting Ivysaur, an Ivysaur under the ownership of a

                  Red has a Venusaur nicknamed Saur which he received as a 
                  Bulbasaur from Professor Oak in Bulbasaur, Come Home! after 
                  witnessing the bond shared between the two while battling a 
                  wild Machoke, learning Solar Beam in the process. Bulbasaur 
                  evolved into Ivysaur in Wartortle Wars after defeating a wild
                  Primeape, and into Venusaur in The Winged Legends while 
                  fighting against the merged version of Zapdos, Moltres, and 
                  Articuno along with Blue's Charizard and Blasty, defeating it
                  with his augmented Solar Beam while the others used 
                  Flamethrower and Hydro Pump, respectively. In the Omega Ruby 
                  & Alpha Sapphire chapter, he has obtained a Venusaurite, with 
                  it he can Mega Evolve into Mega Venusaur.
                   A Venusaur was fantasied along with the other fully evolved 
                  Kanto Starters in Chinchou in Charge, where the Pokémon 
                  Association Chairman of Kanto and Johto explains to Bill and 
                  Janine the special privilege of entering the finals 
                  unconditionally after collecting the badges.
                   A Venusaur appeared alongside a Poliwrath in PSs1, kidnapping
                  Pibu.

                  Charmander debuted in the first round of the Red, Green & Blue
                  chapter, A Glimpse of the Glow, where one appeared in a 
                  fantasy explanation of Red and as one of Blue's first Pokémon,
                  received from his grandfather Professor Oak. He has since 
                  evolved into Charmeleon before facing Brock of Pewter City, 
                  and then to Charizard before the Silph Co. battles against 
                  Team Rocket. The major powerhouse of his team with his newly 
                  learned Blast Burn attack, his battle skills (able to defeat 
                  Red's Poliwhirl easily even before evolving) are complimented 
                  by his fast flight, for which he was traded to Red twice, 
                  during both the Gold, Silver & Crystal chapter and the FireRed
                  & LeafGreen chapter. It is worth noting that, as Charmeleon, 
                  he was accidentally traded to Red many years earlier.
                   Another Charmander appeared as a silhouette when Green 
                  explains about Mew in The Jynx Jinx.
                   After X's Marisso lost to him in a battle X decided to take 
                  him and named him Salamè in Chespin Sows the Seeds of Change. 
                  He later evolved into a Charmeleon alongside Marisso who 
                  evolved into a Quilladin in Quilladin Stands.

                  Charmeleon debuts in Onix is On!, battling in the Pewter Gym 
                  as one of Blue's Pokémon. He evolved from Charmander sometime 
                  between The Secret of Kangaskhan and this round. When Red and 
                  Blue collided in Celadon City, Red mistakenly picked up the 
                  Poké Ball of Blue's Charmeleon, but he managed to give it back
                  to Blue later. He has since evolved into Charizard with Blue's
                  intense training, and became even more powerful, assisting in 
                  the defeat of both the Team Rocket triads Koga and Sabrina, 
                  and continued to act as the powerhouse for both Blue and Red,
                  in the two times it was (temporarily) traded to him since 
                  then.
                   Multiple Charmeleon were used by Team Galactic Grunts in Exit 
                  Empoleon.
                   X's Charmander, Salamè, evolved into a Charmeleon alongside 
                  Marisso who evolved into a Quilladin in Quilladin Stands.

                  One of Blue's main Pokémon, Charizard, debuted as a 
                  Charmander. With his increased capacity for battle both with 
                  augmented strength and his flight ability, he proved to be a 
                  valuable asset for Blue, both during the Silph Co. battles and
                  in the Pokémon League, where Red's Venusaur narrowly defeated 
                  him. He had evolved from Charmeleon sometime before Kalling 
                  Kadabra. In the X & Y chapter, he has obtained a Charizardite 
                  Y, with it he can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard Y.
                   A Charizard appeared as one of Pryce's ice sculptures in his 
                  gym in Irked Igglybuff and Curmudgeonly Cleffa.
                   A Charizard was fantasied along with the other fully evolved 
                  Kanto Starters in Chinchou in Charge, where the Pokémon

                  unconditionally after collecting the badges.
                   X's Charmeleon, Salamè, evolved into a Charizard during a 
                  battle against Xerosic's Pokémon in Charizard Transforms. He 
                  has a Charizardite X hidden in the flame on the tip of his 
                  tail, with it he can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X.
                   A Poké Ride Charizard appeared in a flashback in PASM17.
